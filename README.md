# PLAY ROULETTE
#### Description/Walkthrough:
This is a text-based roulette game.
 
When the program is run, the screen clears, and the words PLAY ROULETTE are displayed. The player is given the option to buy chips or place a bet. By default, a new player is given 200 chips.
 
When the player chooses to make a bet they are asked how much they’d like to bet. Players are limited to betting only as much as they have in their account. Players are asked how they would like to bet. All valid bets are listed for the player to choose from.
 
The player waits and watches as the ball bounces around the wheel finally landing into a slot. If the players bet matches where the ball landed, they are paid their winnings.
 
The player is given the option to bet again or quit playing. By playing again, the player is offered to purchase more chips or start betting. If the player decides to quit, they are thanked, and the program exits.
 
### Files Included in the Project:
* main.py
 

This is the main project file to run the roulette game. When run it walks a roulette player through buying chips, betting on the result of the spin of a wheel, and lastly giving the player the option to quit the game or keep gambling.
* betting.py
 

This file manages the players bet, and verifies the results of the wheel spin.
* chips.py
 

This is essentially the 'bank,' managing the players chip account.

### The Future
#### Enhancements to add to the program
* Add ability to place multiple wagers.
* Add all available bets in an actual roulette game.
* Add a gui to allow the player to place bets on the board where they want instead of typing.
